[GDELT](https://www.gdeltproject.org/) stands for Global Database of Events, Language and Tone. It's an ambitious project to *"monitor the world's news media from nearly every corner of every country in print, broadcast, and web formats, in over 100 languages, every moment of every day"*.  It is *"the largest, most comprehensive, and highest resolution open database of human society ever created"*.

I was exposed to GDELT for a recent project at work and have been fascinated with it since.  When it was time to decide what to with my capstone project for the [Divergence Academy](https://divergenceacademy.com/)'s [Data Science Immersive](https://divergenceacademy.com/datascience) program, there was no doubt I would use GDELT as the data source.

The name of my project, iGDELT, reflects how I use machine learning on the latest GDELT event files to help me keep up with specific technology and science news that are particularly interesting to me.
