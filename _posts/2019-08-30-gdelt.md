I was exposed to [GDELT](https://www.gdeltproject.org/) at work and have been fascinated with it since.  When it was time to decide what to with my capstone project for the [Divergence Academy](https://divergenceacademy.com/)'s Data Science Immersive program, there was no doubt I would use GDELT as the data source.
