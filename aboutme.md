My name is Thuha Kerber. I'm currently a Principal Software Engineer at Parsons. I love technology and constantly look for new things to learn. Machine Learning/AI has always been a fascinating subject to me. I'm currently going through an intensive and very thorough Data Science Immersive program at Divergence Academy and this website was created to present my capstone project.
